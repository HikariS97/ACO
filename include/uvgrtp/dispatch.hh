    /* System call dispatcher is an optimization technique which aims to minimize
     * the delay application experiences when calling push_frame().
     *
     * The push_frame() is divided roughly into frontend and backend:
     * Frontend is the part that executes in the context of the calling application. During this
     * phase, the HEVC frame is packetized into smaller frames and put into frame queue.
     * On Linux this step is very fast, the application only loops through the HEVC frame and
     * sets pointers to frame queue.
     * On windows it's a little more work because we can't send multiple packets using one system call
     * AND use scatter-gather I/O so it's either or.
     *
     * When the frame has been split into smaller chunks, the frontend will call the backend
     * using trigger_send() functions. This function signals the dispatcher thread that there is
     * a frame waiting to be sent. When trigger_send() returns, the application exists from the
     * library code and the frame is sent in the background.
     *
     * By using a separate dispatcher thread, we're able to reduce the amount of delay application
     * experiences to very small (<50 us even for large frames [>170 kB]) */
